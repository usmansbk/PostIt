PostIt

Introduction
PostIt is a simple application that allows friends and colleagues create groups for notifications. This way one person can post notifications to everyone by sending a message once. The application allows people create accounts, create gropus and add registered users to the groups, and then send messages out to these groups whenever they want.

The root of this project contains 3 directories as follows:
  template - this contains the UI template for the front-end in HTML/CSS
  client - this contains the front-end implementation in ReactJS(Redux)
  server - this houses the back-end implementation in NodeJS-Express-Postgres
